# My Portfolio Website

This portfolio website is a curated, online space that showcases my best work. It's one of the most practical and memorable ways to share my work with press, potential collaborators or employers. The idea is that in just one, centralized space, I can quickly communicate who I am, what I do and how people can contact me. This portfolio website allows me to show a true reflection of my projects, passions and personality.
